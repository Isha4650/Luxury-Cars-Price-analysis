# Luxury-Cars-Price-analysis
This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive car dataset containing details about 11,199 vehicles from various manufacturers. The dataset includes multiple attributes such as Make, Model, Engine HP, Engine Cylinders, Transmission Type, Driven Wheels, Vehicle Size, Fuel Type, city mpg, highway MPG, and MSRP (price).

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the relationships between a carâ€™s technical specifications and its market value. By examining factors like engine performance, fuel efficiency, and vehicle size, we aim to uncover how these features influence pricing trends and consumer choices.

The project began with data cleaning, where missing values and duplicates were identified and removed to ensure data accuracy. After cleaning, various visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, pair plots, and heatmaps were applied to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations.

Through these analyses, the project highlights clear trade-offs between engine power and fuel economy, showing that vehicles with higher horsepower tend to be more expensive but less fuel-efficient. It also reveals that compact cars are generally more economical, while large vehicles offer more power and luxury at higher prices.

Overall, this project provides a clear understanding of automotive market dynamics by connecting performance metrics with pricing and efficiency. The insights gained can support price prediction models, market segmentation, and consumer behavior studies within the automobile industry.
